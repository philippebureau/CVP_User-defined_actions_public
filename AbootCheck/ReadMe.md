# AbootCheck action
You can use this script to check Aboot version for Field Notice 0044

https://www.arista.com/en/support/advisories-notices/fieldnotices/8756-field-notice-44

The script by default will log an entry in CVP Change Control that state if the device needs to be patched or not

AND will create a file (/tmp/AbootCheck.txt) with the same entries for all switches.  The file name and location can be changed by editing the YAML file argument "outfile"

You can use comment (#) in the script to prevent file creation if it is not needed

NOTE : if CVP is in cluster, the file will be created where scriptaction is running.  You can find wich node is running the service with command "cvpi status scriptaction"

To make this script available in CVP Change Controls:
* log into CVP shell as root
* copy the script and YAML file to a local folder 
    - you can copy directly from github using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philippebureau/CVP_User-defined_actions_public/main/AbootCheck/AbootCheck.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philippebureau/CVP_User-defined_actions_public/main/AbootCheck/cfg_AbootCheck.yaml`
* install using script-util 
    - `/cvpi/tools/script-utils upload -path AbootCheck.py -config cfg_AbootCheck.yaml`
